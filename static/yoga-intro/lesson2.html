<p>&quot;By integrating the functions of mind, body, and breath in the same time frame, a practitioner will experience the real joy of yoga practice... The mind closely follows the slow, smooth, deliberate ujjayi yogic breathing; and the yoking of mind and body takes place with the breath acting as a harness.&quot;&mdash;Srivatsa Ramaswami, <i>The Complete Book of Vinyasa Yoga</i></p>

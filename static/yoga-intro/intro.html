<h1>Welcome to the Yoga for Beginners course!</h1>

<p>Before we start, let's go over some important concepts and review the syllabus to ensure a safe and enjoyable practice. While doing yoga, pay careful attention to how you feel during and immediately after each pose. Always remember to listen to your body and know your boundaries. You may experience some of the following sensations which are indicative of a safe practice:
<ul>
<li>feeling of openness and expansiveness</li>
<li>stretching sensation in your muscles</li>
<li>nice burning sensation inside the muscle due to the muscle working</li>
<li>sense of release due to increased blood flow</li>
</ul>
Please adjust your pose or stop altogether if you experience the following:
<ul>
<li>dizziness and lightheadedness, lack of stability, especially in standing poses</li>
<li>intense stretch at the joints (that will feel like a &quot;sharp&quot; stretch)</li>
<li>pain in your neck, shoulders or lower back</li>
<li>tingling sensation in your limbs, feet &quot;falling asleep&quot;</li>
<li>tension in your eyes or jaw</li>
<li>rapid, shallow, heavy breathing</li>
<li>profuse sweating, high heart rate, nausea</li>
</ul>

<h1>Syllabus</h1>
<h2>Lesson 1: Breath of Yoga</h2>
<p>Here you will learn how to practice, direct and feel yogic breathing which is called ujjayi. This is the most important skill in your asana practice, so please get a good grounding in it before moving on to the next lesson.</p>
<h2>Lesson 2: Breath Movement Synchronization</h2>
<p>We will look at each aspect of this important principle and perform asanas that demonstrate it.</p>
<h2>Lesson 3: Tadasana Standing Sequence</h2>
<p>You will learn a comprehensive sequence of poses to exercise the entire body while in tadasana. This lesson is broken into two parts: upper body and lower body.</p>
<h2>Lesson 4: Seated Forward Bends</h2>
<p>This lesson will help you lengthen your entire backside and leg muscles. I recommend you do your practice 1-2 hours after a meal and when you are reasonably healthy. I don't recommend doing yoga when you have a cold or recovering from it. If you are pregnant, I suggest you take prenatal yoga classes instead. You can now start the first lesson in this course, Breath of Yoga. Enjoy!</p>

<h1>Lineage</h1>
<p>Vinyasa Krama come from the lineage of a legendary yogi Sri T. Krishnamacharya, who is widely considered a &quot;father of modern yoga&quot;. You may have heard of his famous students such as Indra Devi, B.K.S. Iyengar, K. Pattabhi Jois, T.K.V. Desikachar and A. G. Mohan. My teacher, Srivatsa Ramaswami, is one the longest standing students of Krishnamacharya, having studied with him for 33 years since age 16.</p>
